# 🤝 Gesture Based Secure Communication using Steganography

## Overview

**Gesture Based Secure Communication using Steganography** is a security-focused application designed to transmit confidential information safely by combining **gesture recognition** and **steganography**. The system converts user gestures into secret messages and embeds those messages into digital media (such as images) so that the communication remains hidden and secure.

This project demonstrates how human–computer interaction and information security techniques can be combined to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

## Problem Statement

Traditional communication channels expose sensitive data to risks such as interception, hacking, and data leakage. Even encrypted messages can raise suspicion. There is a need for a system that:

* Hides the existence of communication itself
* Provides an additional authentication layer
* Ensures secure data transfer

---

## Proposed Solution

This project addresses the problem by:

1. Capturing user gestures as input
2. Converting gestures into encoded messages
3. Embedding the encoded data into an image using **steganography**
4. Transmitting the image securely
5. Extracting and decoding the hidden message at the receiver side

The hidden message remains invisible to attackers, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
